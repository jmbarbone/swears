The goal of `swears` is to add some colorful language to your coding.

## Installation

You can install the developmental version of `swears` from [GitHub](github.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jmbarbone/swears")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(swears)
swear()
```

Want to not be so offensive?

```{r}
swear("censored", id = 1)
swear("alternative", id = 1)
```

Need to censor anything else?

```{r}
censor("What the fuck is this bullshit?")
```

Add cursing to your error messages:

```r
> options(swear.method = "alternative")
> swear_on_stop()
successfully updated error option
> stop()
Error: 
how the heck?

> options(swear.method = "censored")
> df[1]
Error in df[1] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
You're not f*cking subsettable!
```
